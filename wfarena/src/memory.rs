// TODO(jt): @Correctness @Cleanup This file is one of the hairiest uses of unsafe in the entire
// codebase. There's raw pointers, uninitialized memory, static lifetime extension, pinning and
// self-referentiality. Currently, it seems to be working well, but initially miri detected aliasing
// violations with its Stacked Borrows model in the test_memory test. These were fixed (by changing
// &mut Pinned to *mut Pinned), so that the mutable reference to the entire pinned structure doesn't
// compete with the shared self-reference inside the pinned structure. Stacked Borrows reported a
// retagging there, either because the memory location of these references was the same, or maybe
// because of some pointer provenance thing I don't understand. Can we clean this up somehow? Maybe with
// some newer borrowchecker, in the future?

/// Allows mostly-safe resetting the arena and reinitializing the data with [`Memory::reset`]. Also
/// allows for mostly-safe dropping of the data and reclaiming of the arena with
/// [`Memory::drop_and_reclaim_arena`].
///
/// Default [`Drop`] leaks both the arena and the data.
///
/// [`Memory`] can be moved around like a regular struct, even though the data has a shared
/// reference to the arena. This is achieved by storing the arena in stable memory (inside its own
/// allocation) and passing a derived [`ArenaScope`] to the initializer. The main arena is not reset
/// while [`Memory`] is live, only the scoped arena is.

///
/// The only unsafety comes from the fact that the arena could leak outside, e.g. with
/// [`Vec::allocator`], and once leaked, resetting the arena is UB.
///
/// For instance, there may be data around that used the leaked arena for its allocations. The data
/// is now potentially overwritten.

/// is already UB, because resetting takes a `&mut` to the arena, and `&mut`s must be unique.
