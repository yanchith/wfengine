// If we know that we'll be entering a part of the program after which we can reset all of the
// allocations made inside, we can do so explicitly with Arena::scope. After the scope guard is
// dropped, the arena will once again have available the memory that was used while the scope was
// active.
//
// Scopes are also useful for bulk processing of data. For example, we may have to process a large
// amount of data spread across thousands of smaller files. We'd like to use arenas for this, but
// not reset them entirely after each processed batch, because maybe we still care about the data
// stored inside. Scopes allow us to reset just the tail part of the arena:
//
// fn process_data(temp: &Arena, files: &[File]) {
//     for f in files {
//         // Each time through the loop, temp gets reset back to state
//         // it was in at the beginning of the function.
//         process_file(arena.scope(), f);
//     }
// }
